<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        Breccia (pronounced /<a href='lexicon.brec'>brɛ́kɪə</a>/) is a lightweight markup language
        for point-form outlining and drafting based on lineo-hierarchically ordered elements of text
        known as a fracta, or fractums.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Filename extension `.brec`.</li>
        <li>Media type `text/plain`.</li> <!-- Till some benefit accrues from adopting a proper type.
          Hopefully by then Firefox will have learned to show type `text/x-` content in the browser. -->
        <li>Character encoding UTF-8.</li></ul></section>
