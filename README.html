<h1 lang='en-CA'>Breccia: lightweight markup for outlining and drafting</h1>
<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        Breccia is a lightweight markup language for point-form outlining and drafting based on nestable,
        sentence-like elements of text known as fracta, or fractums.  Breccia aims not at rich text, but
        at logically structured text.  For an example of what it looks like, see the
        <a href='language_definition.brec'>language definition</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Filename extension `.brec`.</li>
        <li>Media type `text/plain`.</li> <!-- Till some benefit accrues from adopting a proper type.
          Hopefully by then Firefox will have learned to show type `text/x-` content in the browser. -->
        <li>Character encoding UTF-8.</li></ul></section>
