<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        Breccia (pronounced /<a href='lexicon.brec'>brɛ́kɪə</a>/) is a lightweight markup language
        for outlining and drafting based on hierarchical indentation of points and subpoints.
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Filename extension `.brec`.</li>
        <li>Media type `text/plain`.</li> <!-- Till some benefit accrues from adopting a proper type.
          Hopefully by then Firefox will have learned to show type `text/x-` content in the browser. -->
        </ul>
