Breccia: specification of the markup language

    = define syntax graphically
        - as in the JavaScript specification
        - instead of textually

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Aside point`
    < a type of material point
    - bulleted ‘/’

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Bullet`
    - all points begin with a bullet
    * form
        - perfectly indented
        - first character, one of:
            ∪ neither whitespace nor a backslash
            ∪ a backslash
                - immediately followed by zero or more backslashes
                  and a character that is neither whitespace nor a backslash
                ( viz. not block commentary
        - end boundary, one of:
            ∪ inline commentary
            ∪ a space immediately after a non-alphanumeric character
                < allows for embedded spacing, but only after an alphanumeric character
            ∪ a newline and any spaces that precede it

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Citation`
    * inline citation
        - a URI in a place that does not call for a URI
            ( e.g. mixed in with ordinary text
            - not a URI reference
                - here URI references go unrecognized by the parser
                ( for lack of any reliable distinguishing mark
        - when followed immediately by punctuation (such as ‘.’)
          that might otherwise be taken as part of the URI,
          the URI must be quoted, e.g. by backquotes or angle braces
    * associative citation
        < § command point § associative citation

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Command point`
    < a type of formal point
    - bulleted ‘:’
    - commands execute in document order
    + associative citation
        < a type of command point
        - associates for citation purposes a preceding character sequence (the referrer)
          with a particular referent
        - referrers may overlap or nest in any manner
        - a single referrer may associate with multiple referents
        = factor out the particular associative subform `@` -
            - from the general associative form '…', which may have (in future) other subforms
            - considering ‘;’ as a separator of multiple subforms within the same associative form
        * form

              : ['PATTERN']  @  REFERENT-URI

              : ['PATTERN']  @  REFERENT-CONSTRUCT-INDICATOR  [[@] REFERENT-URI]

            - quoting with either ‘"’ (Unicode 22) or ‘'’ (Unicode 27)
            - PATTERN
                - a Perl compatible regular expression
                - indicates the referrer
                - if omitted then the referrer is the whole of parent P, as defined below
                - else the referrer is the result of applying the pattern to some component (C)
                  of parent P, as follows:
                     - if the command point has a principal construct as its parent
                        - then P is that construct
                        - if P is a point
                            - then C is P’s descriptor
                        - else P must be a divider
                            - then C is P
                    - else P is the document descriptor and C is the whole of P
                    - else the command point is misplaced and the document is malformed
            - referent indicator
                - REFERENT-CONSTRUCT-INDICATOR
                    - a construct indicator
                        ( § principal construct § construct indicator
                    - used only to cite a Breccian source
                    - indicates the referent as a Breccian principal construct
                - REFERENT-URI
                    - a URI reference, indicator of either the referent
                      or (in the presence of a construct indicator) the referent’s document
                    - optional in the presence of a construct indicator,
                      where it defaults to the same document as the referrer
    + null command
        < a type of command point
        - does nothing
        * form

              :

    + set perfect indentation
        < a type of command point
        - specifies the number of space characters in each unit of perfect indentation
            - the default is 4
      / - applies to subsequent siblings and their ancestors
      // it would overburden syntax highlighters, such as that of `Emacs/Breccia_mode.el`
        - not yet implemented, pending need
        * form

              : indent NUMBER

            - the minimum is 2

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Commentary`
    * form
        ( per line
        - begins with one or more consecutive backslashes ‘\’ (Unicode 5C)
            - immediately preceded by a space or the line start
            - immediately followed by a space or the line end
        - continues to the line end
    + inline commentary
        - commentary subsequent to non-commentary on the same line
        ( ‘commentary’ not ‘comment’, because the comment as a whole may extend across lines
    + block commentary
        * comment block
            - a sequence of lines comprising commentary alone
            - a comment block either succeeds the start of a principal surface,
              whereby it is part of that surface, or it is part of the document descriptor
        * comment block label
            - in a comment block
            - in a line of commentary delimited by two or more consecutive backslashes ‘\\’
            - the label is the part subsequent to the backslash delimiter,
              exclusive of terminal whitespace

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Divider`
    < a type of principal construct
    * surface form
        - begins with a perfectly indented line headed by a division mark
        - the end boundary is the next principal construct headed by a character
          other than a division mark, or the end of the document
        - it follows that no two divider surfaces are contiguous,
          rather their combination forms one divider surface
    + division mark
        - Unicode 2500-259F
        < division mark = drawing character ∪ inversion mark
        * drawing character
            - Unicode 2500-2587, 2589-258F, 2591-259F
        * inversion mark
            - Unicode 2588 (full block), 2590 (right half block)
    + divider label
        - a sequence of non-division-mark characters in a divider surface,
          exclusive of terminal whitespace
        - normally the label is presented in bold face
        * inverse label
            - a sequence of non-division-mark, non-newline characters in a divider surface,
              exclusive of terminal whitespace, which is preceded on the same line by an inversion mark
              with at most space characters between the two
            - normally the inverse label, together with any terminal whitespace,
              is presented in inverse video
                - except that any inline commentary is still presented in plain video
            - where a full block character succeeds an inversion mark on the same line,
              with at most non-division-mark characters in between,
              that full block is disabled as an inversion mark
                - viz. the full block pairs with the preceding inversion mark,
                  and by itself does not start a new inverse label
                - viz. a single full block trailing an inverse label cannot start a second inverse label

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Document`
    - comprising any number of principal constructs, possibly preceded by a document descriptor
    * document descriptor
        - any text prior to a principal construct
    * document title
        - any document title is determined by the first construct in document order that yields
          a non-empty result after collapsing the whitespace of the relevant part of its content,
          according to the construct type:
            | document descriptor
                - its non-commentary content
            | point
                - the non-commentary content of its surface
            | divider
                - its first label

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Exception point`
    < a type of material point
    - bullet comprising or terminated ‘!!’
    - justified by the purpose of drafting, where the ability to note exceptions is a useful aid
        ( /project.brec § definition

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Generic point`
    < a type of material point
    - a material point of a form here assigned no special role

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Jointer`
    < a type of formal point
    * example

          ⋱⋱ etc/whatever.br

    * form

          ⋱[⋱]  ['CONSTRUCT-PATTERN']  [CONSTRUCT-SCOPER]  [[@] URI-REFERENCE]

        - the diagonal ellipsis (Unicode 22F1) may be single ‘⋱’ or double ‘⋱⋱’
        - quoting with either ‘"’ (Unicode 22) or ‘'’ (Unicode 27)
        - CONSTRUCT-PATTERN
            - the pattern of the subjoint principal construct
                ( § principal construct § construct pattern
            - optional, defaults to the text of the jointer’s parent surface modified thus:
                - trimmed of commentary
                - trimmed of leading whitespace on the first line
                - regexp quoted
                - all whitespace collapsed to \s+
                    ( neutralizing differences in indentation and line wrapping
                - in the case of a parent divider
                    - all repeats of a drawing character C collapsed to C+
                        ( neutralizing differences in horizontal length, e.g. owing to indentation
                - anchored by prepending with `\i` -
            - will not match a jointer
                = move to a functional §
            - modification to the pattern form in this context
                - `\q` expands to the default modified thus:
                    - in the case of point, exclusive of the leading portion
                      comprised of the bullet through the first letter of the descriptor
                        ( excluded as one may wish to alter the case of the first letter
                        - if there is no descriptor, or it ends with its first letter,
                          then `\q` is misplaced, and therefore the pattern is malformed
        - CONSTRUCT-SCOPER
            - the scope qualifier of the CONSTRUCT-PATTERN
                ( § principal construct § construct scoper
        - URI-REFERENCE
            - URI reference of the document of the subjoint construct
            - the use of the ‘@’ separator is optional, a matter of preference
            - optional, defaults to the same document as the jointer

            - `\i` expands to `^\t*`,
              an anchored, leading sequence of perfect indentation
